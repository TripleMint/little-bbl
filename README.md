# little bbl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Suitey/little-bbl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Suitey/little-bbl)

little bbl is a Python library to query nyc.gov data for borough, block and lot info.
little bbl scrapes the NYC DOF page to resolve the BBL for a given address. The DOF page
has proven to be more reliable than scraping ACRIS directly.

It has a shiny new github page here -> [little bbl](http://suitey.github.io/little-bbl) (ooooh aaaaaaah)

## Requirements
 * [Python](http://www.python.org/) (duh)
   * Tested with Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.3 (but we aren't doing anything crazy so it is probably safe to assume it works on 2.7+)
 * [Requests](http://python-requests.org)
   * Tested with 2.0.0 and 2.2.0
 * [BeautifulSoup==4.3.2](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)
 * [six](http://pythonhosted.org/six/) (For supporting python 2 and 3)
   * Tested with 1.5.2

## Usage

    import littlebbl

    # Takes street number, street, unit and borough
    > resolved = littlebbl.resolve('20', 'east 68th street', '3B', 'MH')
    > resolved
      Out: (u'1', u'01382', u'1003')  # (borough, block, lot) 
      
The borough codes are:

    'MH' = Manhattan
    'BX' = Bronx
    'BK' = Brooklyn
    'QN' = Queens
    'SI' = Staten Island

## Reliability (disclaimer)

We would be remiss if we did not mention that the data we are getting this from is ruled by the law of the djungle. It is different for coops, condos and condops. And sometimes you actually need a weird unobvious value for the unit id to get access (sorry for digressing). We do however estimate that this will give you what you are looking for about ~80 % of the time.

For a minor digression on the state of the data we recommend reading [this](http://corenyc.com/blog/2008/10/actionable-data/).
